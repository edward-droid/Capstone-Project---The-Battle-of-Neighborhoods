    "### City of Toronto has its Dine Safe program which inspects all food establishments in the City of Toronto to make sure they meet health standards. Therefore, we can use the data from the program to determine the total number of dining establishments in Toronto and the number of establishments per ward(district). Some of the establishments are not restaurants - for example, some are nursing homes, food shelters, food manufacturers, etc. We will define “restaurant competitor” broadly since these days supermarkets and food carts can compete with restaurants so “any establishment that the general public may buy ready-to-eat food from” will be used as the definition of competitor. The key distinguishing terms in the definition are accessibility to the general public and ready-to-eat food which eliminates establishments such as nursing homes and food manufacturing plants. \n",

    "Ward 15 can be summarized as a ward with many high-income individuals with United Kingdom ethnicity. Furthermore, high-priced ethnic cuisine such as Italian and Japanese cuisine would do well as evidenced from the commonality of these restaurants among venues. If the investor reading this report has access to chefs who can prepare high-end Italian or Japanese food, Ward 15 would be ideal to set up a high-priced restaurant specializing in Italian or Japanese food. Other ethnic foods with a reputation for high-price are French, American, and Continental. One seeking to set up a restaurant in Ward 15 could also consider these types of cuisine even though this project did not find that there were many French, American or Continental restaurants in the ward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ward 17 is a ward with a mainly low to middle income population. There are a little more than 7,000 individuals earning more than $100,000 which is less than half the number in Ward 15. The predominant ethnic group is by far Chinese with almost 33% of the total population so a mid-priced Chinese restaurant should do well as evidenced by the commonality of Chinese restaurants within in the ward. Also, the ward is likely not yet saturated with Chinese restaurants since there are 442 Customers per Restaurant in the ward which is the 3rd highest number of customers per restaurant ratio among all 25 Toronto wards. Furthermore, Ward 17 has the highest population density and the highest growth rate among our 4 candidate wards so it probably offers the best opportunity for people who have access to chefs who can cook Chinese food.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ward 2 and Ward 20 also offer some favorable characteristics and were originally included in the candidate wards list but the most common restaurants returned which were ‘sandwich place’, ‘pizza place’ and ‘fast food’ are not specific enough to come up with as strong a recommendation as could be done for Ward 15 and Ward 17. \n"

    "Choosing the ideal location for a new restaurant is not very simple. The most attractive locations tend to be ones with high population density, a population with high disposable income, and population growth. However, the most attractive locations also attract the most competitors. As a result. the goal of this study was to find attractive locations that have not yet been saturated by over-competition. Sometimes the ideal location may seem counter-intuitive as was the case in this project’s analysis which found that the two best locations for a new restaurant were in wards with medium density and away from the city’s downtown core.

    "Despite this project’s analysis, this project does not consider commercial rental prices in the wards mentioned and the cost of labor. Also, this project has not looked into specific intersections or neighborhoods within the ideal wards where a restaurant would do well. As well, high-level research should be complemented by field research by physically visiting the neighborhoods and visiting some of the existing businesses and talking to the locals who live in the area. This deeper level of analysis is beyond the scope of the project and should be undertaken within a business plan before making an investment decision. However, the information learned from this project’s analysis should help an investor start his or her journey to becoming a successful restauranteur in Toronto. "
